Major tasks that would need to be performed:
- Add the fact that the external parties have selective states interest - this has very very large ramification throughout the entire code and cannot be implemented in steps without robust safeguards.
- Address the decrease in partial knowledge of all agents when participating in teams or coalitions are the partial knowledge is only transmitted between agents interacting leading to a small exchange of knowledge for all of the members.
- Find how to calculate the appropriate belonging level for agents which are in teams.
- Address the issue of initialisation of the policy hierarchy partial beliefs (3S). This has an major impact on the conflict level calculations.
- Address the fact that for the conflict level of the shadow network of the teams, the full knowledge is used to constitute the conflict level which puts the teams at an advantage in their actions compared to individuals. (This is related to an assumption on the partial knowledge of teams)
